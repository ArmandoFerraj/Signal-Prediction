# Machine Learning Sonar Project: Binary Classification Problem

Project Overwiew:
-	The task is to train a model that can discriminate metal and rock objects from sonar signals.
-	We explore 6 machine learning algorthms for our model. 
-	Logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, na√Øve bayes, classification and regression trees, k nearest negihbors and support vector machines (LR, LDA, NB, CART, LNN, SVM).
-	We evaluated and compared models using 10 fold cross validation and classification accuracy. 
-	It was found that transforming the data then using SVM produced the best results achieving 92.8% accuracy.
-	The libraries used were sci-kit learn, numpy, scipy, pandas and matplotlib.

Objectives:
-	Analyze data
-	Evaluate algorithms
-	Improve accuracy 
-	Finalize model

Analyze Data:
- We analyzed our data with statistics and visualizations.
-	Histogram & Density Plot: Some attributes resemble a gaussian distribution, others an exponential.

-	Box and whisker plot: The attributes appear to have a differing mean. Standardizing the data may provide benefit.

-	Correlation Matrix: The patches around the diagonal suggest attributes next to each other are in general, more positively correleated with one another.

Evaluate Algorithms:
- We evaluated the 6 algorithms and compared their performances.
-	LR had the best results with a mean accuracy of 77.9%. 
- Distribution of accuracy:

Improve Accuracy:
- To improve accuracy we standardized the dataset. Pipelines were implemented to avoid data leakage.
-	KNN and SVM had the best results with a mean accuracy of 80.8% and 82.6%  respectively.
- Distribution of accuracy:

Finalize Model:
- KNN and SVM show the most promise for a model. Thus we experimented with these two candidates.
- We tuned the parameters for KNN and SVM to find the most optimal configuration.
-	It was found that SVM with radial basis function as the kernel and C= 1.7 scored the best with 85.0% accuracy.
- To finalize the model 80% of the dataset is used to train, 20% to make predictions.

Results:
- The final model achieved an accuracy of 92.8% on unseen data. This surpasses our estimate of 85.0%. The predictions made by our model are depicted below.
