# ML Sonar Project: Binary Classification Problem

Project Overwiew:
-	The task is to train a model that can discriminate metal and rock objects from sonar signals
-	We explore 6 machine learning algorthms for our model. 
-	Logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, na√Øve bayes, classification and regression trees, k nearest negihbors and support vector machines (LR, LDA, NB, CART, LNN, SVM).
-	We evaluated and compared models using 10 fold cross validation and classification accuracy. 
-	It was found that transforming the data, then using SVM produced the best results for this problem.
-	The libraries used were sci-kit learn, numpy, scipy, pandas and matplotlib

Objectives:
-	Analyze data.
-	Evaluate algorithms
-	Improve accuracy 
-	Finalize model
